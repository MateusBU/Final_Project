# Backend Project Setup and Commands

This project is a study platform using **Vue**, **Knex**, and **PostgreSQL**. Below is a brief explanation of the technologies and backend commands used to configure and manage the application.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Overview

### Vue.js
Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework used for building interactive user interfaces and single-page applications (SPAs).

### Knex.js
Knex is a SQL query builder for Node.js. It supports migrations, seeding, and flexible database interactions.

### PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system known for reliability and feature robustness.

## üì¶ Backend Commands

### Backend Commands Project
#### `npm start`

Runs the backend by executing `index.js` (or whatever entry point is defined in your `package.json` under the `scripts` section).  
Typically used to start an Express server or similar Node.js backend and make your API accessible (e.g., http://localhost:3000).

### Backend Commands KNEX

#### `knex init`
Initializes Knex in your project by creating a knexfile.js, where database configurations for different environments (development, production, etc.) are defined.

#### `knex migrate:make create_table_users`
Creates a new migration file named create_table_users in the migrations folder.
Inside this file, you define the structure of the users table (columns, types, constraints, etc.).


#### `knex migrate:make create_table_users`
Edit the generated file to define the schema for the users table.

#### `knex migrate:make create_table_categories`
Generates a new migration file named create_table_categories, which will define the categories table.


#### `knex migrate:make create_table_categories`
Use this to store article categories or topics in the database.

#### `knex migrate:make create_table_articles`
Creates a migration file for the articles table.
